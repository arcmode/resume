		p
			| Since I was a Biology student at the University of Chile 
			| one of my primary interests is the programatic study of 
			| living sistems and systems theory.

		p
			| Computers and electronics where always around during my 
			| formation as a scientist and at some point I felt more 
			| interested about the devices and software used in the lab
			| than the organisms being studied.
